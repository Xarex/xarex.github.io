<h2>Connecting to DreamHost DreamObjects API </h2>
<p><strong><em>November 30, 2020</em></strong> &mdash; <a href="https://mbsy.co/jjHJM" target="_blank">DreamHost</a> was not my first web host, but it was my first American web host. 
A friend recommended it to me when DreamHost offered some really cool stuff back in the day, as they were experimenting, and were less confident in their services. 
A friend referred me and upon clicking his link, I was granted 6 free domains, unlimited emails, etc. I paid for the 10-year plan just to lock in at whatever rate it 
came to which was around $5.95 per month, which is a slight savings, though depending on how long you hold the newer accounts for, you might be saving more than I did 
at that rate. Nonetheless, I have a 10-year "light contract" with DreamHost and I'm not even sure if they offer those plans anymore. But I've been a member of DreamHost 
since early 2013. You could say I'm a fan.</p>

<p>DreamHost has offered many services over the year, for which I was a beta user of many of them, before moving on to other projects. I still use DreamHost for basic 
projects, such as single pages, and quick websites that I need to throw up real quick. I even have one client who is on the DreamCompute, which is just a scary basic 
beast in itself. DreamHost won't give you full support for anything you do on it, leaving you to a machine that solely belongs to you. Do as you wish, but don't 
expect DreamHost to save you should anything go wrong. Switch to the Shared Hosting plan or even a DreamPress plan, and DreamHost will do its best to take care of you.</p>

<p>Somewhere along the line, DreamHost released <a href="https://mbsy.co/jjHJM?url=https://www.dreamhost.com/cloud/storage/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DreamObjects</a> 
which, in a sense, was not anything that could be considered successful in a sense, and yet, is one of DreamHosts' most powerful and cheapest tools, even beating most pricing 
scales that AWS offers. DreamHost focuses on small to medium sized businesses, while AWS is geared more towards big business to corporations that can afford that the $50 plus 
price tag that often comes with object storage. DreamHost, however, figured out a way to make a very valuable scalable, unlimited service, that automatically cached itself, 
and I believe, in the 13 years I have been with DreamHost, this object storage server only went down once: when they switched from us-west-1 to us-east-1. Any other downtime 
was likely due to my own errors. In this sense, you can say this is quite a powerful tool. I couldn't tell you exactly where this data center is hosted, but DreamHost 
has not focused on building tools that bridge the gap and make this object storage easier to use with websites.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.whatsthehost.com/dreamhost-vs-aws-hosting/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Compare DreamObjects to AWS</strong></a></p>

<p>That is where the <a href="https://dreamobjectsapi.com" target="_blank">DreamObjects API</a> tool comes in. Built without permission and absolutely zero approval from DreamHost, 
though somehow the support ticket was magically completed, I will assume I can use the name "DreamObjects" and am not in violation of any copyright or trademark infringements. We scanned the 
terms of service and policy of DreamHost and according to their records, we are not infringinging, so long as we are complimenting DreamHost, and our intentions are not to harm or deface or defame 
the DreamHost name in any way.  Being as we have been with DreamHost for over 7 years now, consider us big fans who just want to make the services of DreamHost even more useful. 
DreamHost is a great company with so much potential and is expanding into many different areas. 
<a href="https://notetoservices.com" target="_blank">NoteToServices</a> saw an opportunity to create a service 
that makes using DreamObjects storage easy, especially considering it now has a WordPress plugin.</p> 

<p>I feel that the customers of DreamHost, including myself, wanted this plugin, that allowed us to use the DreamObjects storage, on our WordPress websites. And thus, 
I have created just that: a service that allows you to not only build your own CDN with DreamObjects storage, but using that very same service, I built a WordPress 
plugin that helps you bridge the gap between your website and the DreamObjects storage service. This will help solve a big issue for many companies that are hosting 
their websites on DreamHost and using WordPress. Instead of relying on the "unlimited storage" which is often not unlimited at all, and your website tends to slow down 
after a while, this will allow you to store everything on the DreamObjects CDN instead, ensuring that even if your website goes down, your assets will never be lost.</p>

<p>While this service is specialized for DreamObjects, it can be used for any AWS storage service so long as you can provide the public and private key, although only 
the main features such as uploading, downloading, and deleting are available, including adding metadata and tagging. Anything beyond this is not currently supported at this time.
