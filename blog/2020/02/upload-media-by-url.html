<h2>Upload Media By URL WordPress Plugin</h2>
<p align="center"><img src="https://my.bincdn.com/1117/upload-media-by-url-play.gif" align="center" alt="Upload Media By URL"></p>
<p><strong><em>February 25, 2020</em></strong> &mdash; In our great strive to learn about developing WordPress plugins, 
we realized we needed somethng and built it into a plugin we were working on for a client. However, this feature serves as a 
personal tool for those clients to upload their media to a CDN. In the process, we realized that an important feature from 
WordPress is missing. In fact, it's never actually been implemented, yet you would think otherwise. We built a WordPress plugin 
    called Upload Media By URL or UMBU.</p>

<p>Uploading by URL is a feature that is missing, yet is actually present in the WordPress Media gallery only when you 
write a post and try to insert media. An option is available if you are not using Gutenberg. Once you click on Add Media, 
you will notice the ability to insert a URL. This entry is for an external URL only, meaning that when you insert that external 
URL into your post, it will keep the external URL.</p>

<p>We built a feature directly into the media library that allows you to upload multiple images via URL. After hitting 
submit, all of the URLs you added to the list will be processed and added to the WordPress Media library. This plugin is 
very simple, free, and is available in the WordPress respository. We are quite excited about this, as it is our first approved 
WordPress plugin.</p>

<p>The object of what it does was simple, allowing for you to add new images to the gallery from a URL, rather than having to 
either download that URL and re-upload it through your WordPress Media library. A search of the WordPress plugin repository 
revealed that no one has built this plugin. It does not exist. There is no plugin out there in which you can enter in the URL 
and it will automatically download to your website and be inserted into the media library. Thus, we are happy to have practiced 
with WordPress plugin development and are happy to offer this for free.</p>

<p>Download it from the  
<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/upload-media-by-url/" target="_blank">
https://wordpress.org/plugins/upload-media-by-url/</a> or directly from <a href="https://bincdn.com/?dn5nbpgpfth">NoteToServices</a>.</p>
