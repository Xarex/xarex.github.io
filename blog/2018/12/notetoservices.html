<h2>Welcome To NoteToServices</h2>
<p><strong><em>December 29, 2018</em></strong> &mdash; You have probably never heard of <strong>NoteToServices</strong> because we are a small company. 
You have probably never seen or used our products, but hopefully you will. We often release them on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hacker News</a> 
or <a href="https://producthunt.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Product Hunt</a> or any site that might help startups or small businesses get 
some noticed for their products. We are not Google or Apple or Microsoft. Our office is remotely working at home. We outsource to freelancers and 
others who help us. What we do is come up with product ideas and debate on whether they are useful or not. Afterwards, through polling, discussion, 
and generally believing something will be useful, we create it. We are dedicated to making products that are useful to everyday individuals and 
businesses. We focus on everything from taking notes, reminder services, communication services, blogging services, hosting websites, data storage 
centers, and more.</p>

<p>Each year, we try to come up with and work on 2-3 useful web applications for everyday businesses. We are always happy to collaborate and help others
and learn in the process. The web applications you see listed in our portfolio, located on the homepage of this website, are web apps we began in
2015. We utilized several technologies, converting our earliest apps from PHP 5.4 to PHP 7.x, and are quite fond of apps making use of the powerful 
MySQL database. With NoteToServices, you will receive personalization and as much general customization as we can offer. We continue to support 
every web application we create and provide an easy way to contact us via Tawk.To. We do not like to leave anyone hanging, so we'll always get back 
to you if you leave a message.</p>

<p>Thank you for visiting. Please feel free to incorporate our applications into your everyday routine. If you have any suggestions, comments, 
or feedback, don't hesitate to reach out to us.</p>
</p>

<p>Feel free to <a href="../../../contact.html">contact us</a> for inqueries or quotes.</p>
