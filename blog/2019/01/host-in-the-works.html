<h2>New Host In The Works</h2>
<p><strong><em>January, 31, 2019</em></strong> &mdash; Last year, we at <strong>NoteToServices</strong> spent time building a WordPress Managed 
Hosting solution to take away the many pain points of starting a host, installing WordPress, finding and activating the necessary plugins, and 
optimizing the WordPress platform. We decided to build a host we called <a href="https://wpbubble.com" target="_blank">WP Bubble</a> which would 
take care and automate just about every process for the web developer or web designer, including optimizing the server, automating the backup process,
taking care of all things htaccess, blocking bad bots, daily malware scans, taking care of the cache, automatically configuring the security settings, and even 
enhanced with Cloudflare for optimal performance. It was definitely a success for us &mdash; and our clients. It was our first attempt 
at building our own web host and we succeeded. While the marketing was little, we did acquire 2 or 3 clients in 2018 who are very happy to have 
their websites on <a href="https://wpbubble.com" target="_blank">WP Bubble</a>. However, this host was specifically designed for WordPress and we 
wanted something for all of the projects we were not using Wordpress for, and thus, we came up with a brand new hosting solution: 
<a href="https://baremetalhost.com" target="_blank">Bare Metal Host</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://baremetalhost.com" target="_blank">Bare Metal Host</a> comes with all the power of a dedicated server without the associated costs 
of a dedicated server, which can range upwards of $60-$300. To rent the server comes at a heavily discounted price if you decide to go on the yearly plan,
saving you over 4,500% in costs. The Bare Metal Host gives you access to an Intel(R) Xeon(R) E3-1270v6 @ 3.80GHz CPU. While it is not Cloudflare enhanced,
it is amazingly fast and will run just about everything you throw at it. You have access to very powerful resources that cannot be found on any cheap 
VPS plans. With every website comes free SSL, access to sFTP and SSH, a database, automated database backups, and an unlimited CDN storage service.</p>
<p>Most importantly, you are quite literally receiving the power of 8 cores to process your website. No other host can really compete with that. 
We are quite proud of our work and think of it as an ongoing project, but have provided the very greatest basics that you could possibly need to 
run your website without worry.</p>
<p>If you want to give our new host a try, get started for as little as $2.49 per website by signing up for a yearly subscription. You will not find this savings 
anywhere else, and if you do, that price often comes with a one-year agreement. Your price will never change as long as you stay signed up to the service.
Any time we raise our prices, you will be grandfathered into any plans that you do not cancel.</p>
<p>We have several other projects going on this year as well, including getting <a href="https://notetoemail.com" target="_blank">NoteToEmail</a>, 
<a href="https://notetovoice.com" target="_blank">NoteToVoice</a>, and <a href="https://notetotext.com" target="_blank">NoteToText</a> fully 
functioning and operational. We are also working on a bare-minimum writing platform called <strong>WriteTufte</strong> 
that minimizes distractions yet displays information and content 
beautifully. And a latest project suggestion that we are also working on is called <strong>EditHours</strong> which keeps track of the times 
you have been working on something, including how much you should be charging, so you don't lose track of your time or money. 
So stick around and keep visiting for updates!</p>
