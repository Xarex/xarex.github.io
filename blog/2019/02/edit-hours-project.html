<h2>The Edit Hours Project</h2>
<p><strong><em>February 1, 2019</em></strong> &mdash; When it comes to custom work, it is not always easy to keep track of exactly how many hours 
you dedicated to a project, a task, or anything asked of you. Whether you begin the clock at a certain time, get tasked with other tasks or 
assignments at work, it can be easy to get distracted from what you are doing. With 
<a href="https://edithours.com" target="_blank"><strong><em>Edit Hours</em></strong></a>, you can track your time for doing specific tasks with notes 
to include to ensure you know exactly what you did, are doing, still have to do, etc.</p>

<p>This project was done for my primary company, <a href="https://multivu.com" target="_blank">MultiVu</a> to help us keep track of the work we do 
for clients. Originally, it was going to be a paid web app, but it was made free for anyone to use. While the capabilities of keeping track of exact 
payment were not added in, this can easily be done by at least just knowing the time and multipying that time by the amount you should be getting paid. 
At most, up to 50 times will be shown at once. You can export the times from today up to a year ago, or even export every single time you have tracked. You can also view today only or a year ago, or every time you have tracked. If you are looking 
for something specific, you can search by title or by a note you left yourself. You also have the ability to sort times by ascending or descending 
times. That is really all there is to it. It is a basic time keeper to help you keep track of your projects.</p>

<p>The application is very easy to use and is as easy as hitting start, stop, and adding or editing the time. If you have any suggestions for 
additional functionality to enhance this project for your own use, feel free to contact us. We might just add it for you if we find it useful enough.
If you want to just give us a shoutout or a kudos, feel free to contact us and let us know that this project is helping you. This is our second 
project for 2019 and we are very happy to release it for everyone to use. It is also our fourth free project, so feel free to use it as much as you
want!
