<h2>Talk Back Privately With Ectochat</h2>
<p><strong><em>April 1, 2019</em></strong> &mdash; Although it is April 1st, we are actually not kidding when we say that we are offering 
you back your privacy when it comes to chatting online. While we did not fully build this script, and the source code is freely available on 
<a href="https://github.com/chr15m/build-decentralized-web-app" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Github</a>, we have modified some of the code 
to ensure that your privacy and security is in full effect. Never use a chat program again that does not promise the guarantee of complete 
privacy. We are introducing you to <a href="https://ectochat.com" target="_blank">Ectochat</a>.</p>

<p>Ecto means "external" or "on the outside" in Latin, and chat means refers to communication, particularly online. Thus, the reason for 
naming our service <strong><em>Ectochat</em></strong> was to basically say that we are offering the services of an external chatroom, which is 
not internal and we do not keep any records of your communication amongst you or your team. After the tab is closed, there is no way to 
retrieve any of the log. While in many cases, most people want to return to a log, there are many others who want to keep their communication 
channels completely private. Along with the source code we have provided to you above, for which you can make your own decentralized 
chat using Javascript, we are stating that this project is completely open source and for you to freely download. Thus, there is nothing 
to "trust" from us. We are not here to steal your privacy, but rather provide a way for you to protect it. If you wish to save your chat, 
you will have to select all of the text, copy, and paste it somewhere. We do not provide any tools for this and have no interest in what 
you might be talking about. We created this project to help ourselves out and as a way to communicate in complete privacy with others.</p>

<p>Many online chats and communication channels between two people or multiple groups of people are logged by companies, often gathered 
for analytics or unless you have opted out of the logging service, your information may be held indefinitely. With Ectochat, your information 
is completely private, as Ectochat serves as a P2P (Peer-to-Peer) communication channels in which only the browsers are involved. There 
is no logging of data on any server and no database is involved, allowing for speed and security to be the top priority of 
<a href="https://ectochat.com" target="_blank">Ectochat</a>.</p>

<p>When it comes to <a href="https://ectochat.com" target="_blank">Ectochat</a>, no logs are ever saved. A refresh of the screen will reveal 
nothing from a previous conversation. If you wish to log your conversation, please use another chat. Ectochat uses the same technology as 
cryptocurrency in order to ensure the absolute privacy of the individuals communicating within the chat. Anyone can join a chat and the 
amount of people within the chat can be unlimited. All URLs of Ectochat will expire at the end of each day and will no longer be inaccessible. 
In other words, the URL of a newly created chat can be accessed up until midnight of the following day. After the chat expires, 
a new chat must be generated.</p>

<p>You may share the URL of the <a href="https://ectochat.com" target="_blank">Ectochat</a> with anyone. If you wish to generate a new chat 
without having a previously created chat, you can simply share the URL: <a href="https://ectochat.com/new" target="_blank">https://ectochat.com/new</a></p>

<p>Anyone who enters the chat after anything has already been written will not be able to see it. Anyone who leaves the chat and returns will not be able to see previous text. As 
we have stated: this is a P2P chat in which only browsers are connecting to each other to allow for a communication channel. The browser itself 
has no capability of holding information for long periods of time, other than what cookies may be set or information may be logged. 
<a href="https://ectochat.com" target="_blank">Ectochat</a> is great for anyone trying to communicate without leaving any 
trace that there was ever a conversation. It is great for those who prefer to remain as anonymous as possible. 
Nothing is shared, nothing is logged, and we have set a flag to tell robots never to index, archive, or even follow the chat.</p>

<p>Give <a href="https://ectochat.com" target="_blank">Ectochat</a> a try today and start incorporating it into your workflow for a safe 
and secure communication channel!</p>
